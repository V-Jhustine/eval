    <h3>Faculty Evaluation System<p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide an efficient and secured manner of evaluation, the researchers come up with a UCC
            computerized faculty evaluation system which caters opinions of the students towards their 
            professors. After name confirmation, the system will make the students rate the information the 
            researchers provided. The student will evaluate their professors in a paperless manner. </p>

                <p>The faculty evaluation system has some other benefits, it can be used to help teachers hone 
            their instructional skills and guaranteed that each instructor will be the only one who has the access
            to view the answers of the students. The instructor can ask inquiries that will give him information 
            based on the confidential outcomes which can offer suggestions that can help him improve. </p>

                    <p>The instructor can choose which information he/she can utilize to make suggestions on how to 
            improve his teaching skills by asking the right questions on the available data source. The faculty 
            evaluation system will evaluate the professorâ€™s competencies as well as the teaching skills of the 
            performer. It is also designed to identify the teaching strength and weaknesses. This being said, our 
            team would like to propose a browser-based UCC Faculty Evaluation System to help authorized users 
            to fully control the system from the formulation of the questionnaires to students to the analysis of the 
            faculties up to generating and printing evaluation reports that can be viewed statistically.</p></h3>
